Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  -it's a clock that ticks in 12h and 24h formats and the user can add hours, minutes, seconds
What did you do particularly well?
  -I followed the instructions of the assignment as they were given and created the desired functionality
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  -I could have added separate classes for the 24h and 12h clocks and given them their own functions and parameters
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  -I had trouble figuring out the right way to get the clocks to tick up every second, but after some searching online and testing out different methods, I got a solution that         worked
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  -formatting a menu interface was useful experience for the followup assignments and projects that also used a menu
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  -I wrote clear code with appropriately named variables that flows in a logical manner and added comments where necessary.
